# Collaborative-Filtering-Algorithm-ML
Collaborative Filtering is a popular recommendation algorithm that works by analyzing user behavior and identifying patterns in the interactions between users and items. The algorithm recommends items to users based on their past behavior and the behavior of other users with similar preferences.

Formula
The formula for Collaborative Filtering is as follows:

r(i,j) = μ + Σ [(r(i,k) - μ) * w(k,j)] / Σ w(k,j)

where:

r(i,j) represents the predicted rating of item j by user i
μ represents the average rating of all items
r(i,k) represents the rating of item k by user i
w(k,j) represents the similarity between items k and j
